            Fly me to the moon 					<br>
            Let me play among the stars 		<br>
            And let me see what spring is like	<br>
            On a-Jupiter and Mars 				<br>
            In other words, hold my hand 		<br>
            In other words, baby, kiss me 		<br>
                                                <br>
            Fill my heart with song 			<br>
            And let me sing forevermore 		<br>
            You are all I long for 				<br>
            All I worship and adore 			<br>
            In other words, please be true 		<br>
            In other words, I love you 			<br>
                                                <br>
